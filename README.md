In this Repository , I am updating script file for installing the common used packages like NodeJS , CodeDeployAgent , Pyenv , Pyenv Virtual Environment .

STEPS TO RUN THIS SCRIPT FILE - 

1. Save the required script in a file with extension .sh , eg test.sh 

   $ vi test.sh       , here replace 'test' with package name 

2. Change the mod of the file 

   $ chomod u+x test.sh 

3. Execute the file 

   $ ./test.sh 


Following the above three step your package is installed successfully and is ready to use .
